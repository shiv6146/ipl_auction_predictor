The **IPL Auction Predictor** is a machine learning experiment aimed at predicting the auction prices for Indian Premier League (IPL) players based on various player attributes and historical auction data. This repository leverages data collection and preprocessing, feature engineering, regression models to provide insights into player valuations and classification models to predict potential teams bidding for a player during the IPL auctions.

## Overview

In the highly competitive IPL auctions, understanding player valuations can be key for teams to make informed decisions. This project utilizes historical [auction data](https://www.iplt20.com/auction/2025) and [player statistics](https://www.cricbuzz.com/) to build predictive models that estimate auction prices and potential teams that could bid for a player. The primary goal is to provide a tool that:
- Collects, preprocesses and cleans auction and player data.
- Extracts meaningful features such as player role, performance metrics, and past auction values.
- Trains classification & regression models (and possibly ensemble methods) to predict player prices.
- Visualizes insights and trends from the auction data.
